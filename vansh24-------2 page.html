    <h1>About Me - First-Year B.Tech Computer Science Student</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm vansh arora, a first-year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science. I'm passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers. My journey into the world of computer science began with a deep curiosity about how computers work and a desire to be part of the digital revolution.

    <p>
        Currently, I'm immersing myself in foundational computer science concepts, programming languages, and software development. I'm excited to learn and explore more, not only to excel academically but also to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy coding personal projects, collaborating on open-source initiatives, and participating in hackathons. I'm also enthusiastic about playing cricket.
